Since the last\r\nfew have been single page affairs, I decided to go with something a bit more conventional\r\nand threw in four extra page layouts. Beyond that, it's the usual drill: fully responsive,\r\nbuilt on HTML5/CSS3/skel, and CCA licensed like all my other stuff. Sass sources are\r\nalso included for those of you into that sort of thing (entirely optional).\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Michael Domaradzki (md.photomerchant.net) for allowing me to use\r\nhis excellent photos in Twenty's demo*.\r\n\r\n(* = Not included!
